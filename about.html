He has done music collaborations with many popular artists in the Rap industry such as Drake, Young Thug, Lil Uzi Vert, and Future. He has topped the charts numerous times with new albums and music. Although he has been quite successful with his music, he has been in trouble with the law. He was arrested in 2013 with many charges stacked up against him. He was ordered to complete community service in a certain amount of time. He never completed this task, with resulted in 6 months of jail time in a county prison in Terre Haute, Indiana. This sentence had the potential to reach over a year, but the judge saw that he was successful, so he decided to lighten the sentence to 6 months. While behind bars, Gucci Mane learned to change his ways by working out in the gym that was in the facility. When he got out of prison, he dropped an album within 4 hours of his released called "Everybody Looking". He is continuing to make his fans happy by putting out new music quite frequently. </h1>
